# a_coos
Very simple COoperative Operating System for Arduino.

Kernel uses about 1K bytes. Highly portable, it has no assembler code and independent from hardware. System ticks 1 ms based on millis(). Should run on any Arduino board. Tested on Arduino Pro Mini (ATmega328) and RAK Creator Pro (RTL8711).
